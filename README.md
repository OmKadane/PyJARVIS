## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get PyJARVIS running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher
* A working microphone
* An [OpenWeatherMap API Key](https://openweathermap.org/api) (for weather functionality)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/OmKadane/PyJARVIS.git
    cd PyJARVIS
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    * **Windows:**
        ```sh
        python -m venv myenv
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **macOS / Linux:**
        ```sh
        python3 -m venv myenv
        source myenv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your OpenWeatherMap API Key:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project directory (the same level as `main.py`).
    * Add your OpenWeatherMap API key to this file:
        ```
        OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="your_new_api_key_here"
        ```
    * Ensure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure.

### Usage

Once the setup is complete, run the main script from your terminal (with your virtual environment activated):

```sh
python main.py
```

The assistant's GUI will appear, and it will greet you and start listening. Click "Start Listening" if it doesn't begin automatically. You can give it commands like:

* "Open Notepad"
* "What time is it?"
* "Search for Python tutorials"
* "Tell me a joke"
* "Weather in London"
* "Remember this is my task list"
* "Exit"
